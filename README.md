## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a data-driven problem solver transitioning into data engineering.  
Fueled by Starbucks coffee, TWG tea, and a curiosity for clean code.
Some days I am not sure if I love coding because of the caffeine, or if I love the caffeine because I get to code.

This space is where I document what I have learned and how I am growing. 
I believe data should drive business impact, and I am on a mission to make that happen :)
